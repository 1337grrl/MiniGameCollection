# MiniGameCollection
A collection of small games, written in C++ and SFML. Inspired by CS50 Intro into Game Dev (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T383Vx9-4vJYFsJbvZ_D17Qzh)

Initial approach: 
1. Get a short overview on what the game is about.
2. Build it in C++ and SFML. 
3. Check how CS50 did it in Lua/LÃ¶ve2D.
